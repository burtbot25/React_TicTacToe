# React_TicTacToe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game made using the React.js framework.

Using the following tutorial https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html as well as knowledge from completing the React.js lesson on http://www.codecademy.com, I learned and familiarized myself with the following:
  - The basics of the React.js framework
  - Create React applications using component classes and instances
  - Use the ReactDOM.render() function to render components and output
  - How to create and pass props different components
  - Setting, accessing, and updating a component's state
  - JavaScript Syntax Extension (JSX elements) and how to assign attributes
  - How to nest JSX elements
  - Understand the basic concept of "diffing" (how React.js manipulates the Virtual DOM to update certain portions of the webpage by comparing the updated and the pre-updated versions of the webpage)
  - JSX event listeners and conditionals 
  - Understand JSX keys to internally keep track of keys
  - Create elements using React.createElement()
  - Importing React/ReactDOM libraries and external JavaScript files
